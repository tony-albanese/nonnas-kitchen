# Nonna's Kitchen Frontend

# User Stories
Navigation: As a user I can view a navbar from every page so that I can navigate easily between pages
Routing: As a user I can navigate through pages quickly so that I can view content seamlessly without page refresh
Authentication - Sign up: As a user I can create a new account so that I can access all the features for signed up users
Authentication - Sign in: As a user I can sign in to the app so that I can access functionality for logged in users
Authentication - Logged in Status: As a user I can tell if I am logged in or not so that I can log in if I need to
Authentication - Refreshing access tokens: As a user I can maintain my logged-in status until I choose to log out so that my user experience is not compromised
Navigation: Conditional rendering - As a logged out user I can see sign in and sign up options so that I can sign in/sign up
Avatar: As a user I can view user's avatars so that I can easily identify users of the application
